# COVID-19 Chest X-ray Classification using Deep Learning

## Overview

This repository presents a deep learning project focused on classifying chest X-ray images into two categories: COVID-19 positive and normal. Leveraging the power of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the model achieves an outstanding accuracy rate of 97%, demonstrating its potential as a diagnostic tool for COVID-19 detection.


## Project Highlights

- **High Accuracy:** The trained CNN model achieves a remarkable accuracy rate of 97% in classifying chest X-ray images as either COVID-19 positive or normal. This breakthrough showcases the effectiveness of deep learning in medical image analysis.

- **Robust Architecture:** The model architecture is designed with careful consideration, comprising multiple convolutional layers, pooling layers, and dropout layers. The design choices contribute to its ability to capture intricate patterns and features from chest X-ray images.

- **Data Augmentation:** Data augmentation techniques, including shearing, zooming, and horizontal flipping, are employed to enhance the model's robustness and reduce the risk of overfitting.

- **Data Preprocessing:** The project emphasizes the importance of meticulous data preprocessing, ensuring that the input data is properly scaled and normalized to improve convergence during training.

## Getting Started

1. **Dataset:** Prepare your chest X-ray dataset with two subdirectories: "Covid" for COVID-19 positive images and "Normal" for normal images.

2. **Dependencies:** Install the required Python libraries by running:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas keras matplotlib
   ```

3. **Training:** Run the provided Python script to train the CNN model:
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```

4. **Evaluation:** The script will output training and validation accuracy over each epoch. Observe the validation accuracy as the model trains to prevent overfitting.

## Achievements

The success of this project is underscored by its exceptional accuracy rate of 97%, which positions it as a robust solution for identifying COVID-19 cases from chest X-ray images. This accomplishment paves the way for further research and development in the intersection of deep learning and medical imaging.

## Future Enhancements

- **Transfer Learning:** Experiment with transfer learning using pre-trained models to potentially improve accuracy and convergence speed.

- **Data Expansion:** Continuously enrich the dataset with diverse and well-labeled images to enhance the model's generalization capabilities.

- **Web Interface:** Develop a user-friendly web interface for healthcare professionals to conveniently upload and classify X-ray images in real-time.
