# COVID-19-Detection
Deep learning project focused on classifying chest X-ray images into two categories: COVID-19 positive and normal. Leveraging the power of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the model achieves an outstanding accuracy rate of 97%, demonstrating its potential as a diagnostic tool for COVID-19 detection.  Sample COVID-19 X-ray
